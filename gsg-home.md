# Introduction

IoTivity is an open source framework that implements the [OCF](https://openconnectivity.org) (Open Connectivity Foundation) protocol for easy, secure device-to-device communication for IoT devices. IoTivity includes the following:

- A reference implementation of **client software** (e.g., a OTGC Linux client or Android app for controlling a smart home device)
- A reference implementation **server software** that runs on the actual IoT device
- **Tools that generate code** for the server software, based on a JSON file that you will create to describe your deviceâ€™s capabilities

# Learning to Use IoTivity

These 15-30 minute tutorials walk through installing, building, and using client and server software applications that rely IoTivity capabilities. Then, the Digging Deeper section provides the how-to and reference information needed to implement IoTivity on your own device.

[**Getting Started with IoTivity - Device Simulation**](gsg-sw.md)

- Quickly simulates smart device usage by running client and server apps on the same PC, using the OCF protocol to communicate over loopback.

[**Getting Started with IoTivity - Raspberry Pi kit**](gsg-kit.md)

- Experience realistic smart device usage with a Raspberry Pi kit ([purchase here](https://openconnectivity.org/developer/developer-kit), under <u>Development Resources and Solutions</u>). The kit lets you use an Android client app to control a Raspberry Pi with an add-on board that contains colored LEDs and capacitive touch buttons.
